<p align="center">
  <b>Automated Recon Framework</b>
</p>

While Learning Bash Scripting I  Decided To Make This Automated Recon Framework to save time.
Now i released this in beta version, I will make it better and add more features to it in future.

## Setup
    git clone https://github.com/SouravSec/Reconx
    cd Reconx/src
 Now in src you have to install some tools manually, Read [Installation](src/test)
 
 ## Starting the tool
    bash reconx.sh
